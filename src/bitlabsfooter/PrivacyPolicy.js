                    Some of our Platform’s functionality may be used without
                    revealing any personal information, though for features or
                    services related to the Programs, personal information is
                    required. If you do not use these specific features or
                    services on the Platform, then the onlyinformation we
                    collect will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e.,
                    information that cannot be used to identify you).
                    Non-Personal Information includes information like the web
                    pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain
                    features and benefits on our Platform, you may need to
                    submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e.,
                    information that can be used to identify you). Personally
                    Identifiable Information can include, but not be limited to,
                    information such as your name, email address, contact number
                    (cellular and landline), educational qualification(s),
                    Aadhaar number, PAN, social security and tax identification
                    numbers, and post-qualification or work experience among
                    other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy
                    of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to
                    bitLabs. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to
                    use the Platform, the information you receive when using the
                    Platform, and our ability to contact you. For example, your
                    email address should be kept valid because it is one of the
                    primary channels through which we communicate with you.

                    things, which pages of our Platform were visited, the order
                    in which they were visited, when they were visited, and
                    which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information
                    from the URLs through which you connected with our Platform.
                    Collecting such information may involve logging the IP
                    address, operating system and browser software used by each
                    user of the Platform. Although such information may not be
                    considered Personally Identifiable Information, based on
                    local laws, we may be able to determine a user’s Internet

                    point of connectivity from an IP address. We collect
                    Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the Platform

                    personal information. In the case of scholarships, refunds

                    bitLabs, or its Educational Partners and third-party service
                    providers, may, for instance, collect certain information
                    from you in conjunction with assignments, exams and other
                    assessments related to the online course. For example, as

                    third-party service providers) may collect certain
                    Personally Identifiable Information from you in order to (a)
                    verify or authenticate your identity or submissions made by
                    you, such as a signature for a test or an assignment log, a

                    information included on a photo identification card or
                    document, or (b) monitor your performance during an exam to
                    confirm that you are abiding by the applicable test rules or
                    requirements (e.g., confirming that you are not using
                    prohibited resources). bitLabs may also collect information
                    from you or about your performance or your accomplishments,
                    such as quiz/exam scores, grades, project evaluations,

                    performance or accomplishments.

                    Should you need any financial assistance, bitLabs may

                    Should you opt to sign up with such credit facility
                    providers, any information you provide to them will be
